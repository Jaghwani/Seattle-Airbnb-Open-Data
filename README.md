## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was intersected in using Seattle AirBnB homes data to better understand:

1. What Seattle Airbnb home-sharing price rates are?
2. What seasons are occurring in Seattle?
3. How many listings are in Seattle neighborhoods with price rates?
4. What are the important factors that are affect accommodation prices in Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jaghwani.tumblr.com/post/178138334271/3-things-about-seattle-home-sharing).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of code ideas, and to kaggle/AirBnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/home). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
