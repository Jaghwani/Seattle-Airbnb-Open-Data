## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was intersected in using Seattle AirBnB homes data to better understand:
1.	Which are the homes seasons in Seattle?
2.	Which are the neighborhoods in homes business Seattle?
3.	Which are features were assisting with price in Seattle?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
Must give credit to AirBnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
